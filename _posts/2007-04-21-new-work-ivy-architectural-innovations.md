Title: "New Work: Ivy Architectural Innovations"
layout: post

Newly launched: [Ivy Architectural Innovations](http://ivyarchpc.com/), a website for a small but creative architectural firm (suspiciously run by some guy also with the last name of Ivy) in Virginia Beach, VA.

<a href="http://ivyarchpc.com/"><img class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36b36970c" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36b36970c-pi" style="border-width:1px;" /></a>

&gt;Working closely with our clients and their staffs in a two or three day design charrette creates excitement and shortens the length of the schematic design phase. But the greatest benefit is the building of a cohesive, solid goal espoused by all.

This was an exciting project for me - I&#39;ve designed the last 3 websites for Ivy Architectural Innovations, starting back in 1997 while I was still with Artlab Europe, and this one is the one I&#39;m happiest with. I like that it doesn&#39;t obviously look like a CMS-backed site (it&#39;s [Drupal-powered](http://drupal.org)).
