Title: Progress You Can See
layout: post

For a few weeks now, I've been playing with [Movable Type](http://movabletype.org), porting my as-yet-unfinished Friends plugin from WordPress to MT. I've been interested in what's happening in the MT development world for a while now, and this seemed a good way to find out.

Progress has been... stuttering. But I've got the basics in place - Editing and listing your contacts, and last night I got the [template tags done](http://www.flickr.com/photos/redmonk/2359838833/in/set-72157604027970428/) so that I could build a [basic blogroll widget](http://www.flickr.com/photos/redmonk/2360633592/in/set-72157604027970428/) (with XFN and hCard, oh my!).
