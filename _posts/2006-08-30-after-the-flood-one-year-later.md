Today is the 1 year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and the flood that nearly wiped out New Orleans. Jodi and I heard snippets here and there about it, but at the time we were in Kiev, Ukraine, adopting Adelina. So, we missed the media blitz, for which I&#39;m actually grateful.

Today, in memory and for a view of the devestation &quot;from the ground&quot;, I&#39;m browsing Flickr photosets of New Orleans in the aftermath:
