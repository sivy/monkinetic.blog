Title: Crazy Unicycle Guy
layout: post

We went hiking at South Mountain last weekend, and we saw <a href="http://media.redmonk.net/images/uniCycle.jpg">this guy</a> on his mountain-bike-unicycle. He rides the trails over South Mountain just like the other (seemingly thousands) of cyclists. Nuts. Just plain nuts. I can&#39;t imagine the strength or balance required for this.<div align="center">
