I'm in NYC this week visiting [the mothership](http://sixapart.com/services). I forgot how much flying East sucks. Longer time in the air, time change, jet lag. Pheh. On a good note, however, I've gotten to meet my new boss and a bunch of my new co-workers (*waves at David, Kevin, Natalie, Lisa, Angela, Gercek, Adam, and Matt*).

Although it's only 3:30pm PDT right now, I got up at 3:30 this morning so I'm starting to fade. Hoping that means I'll be able to sleep tonight...
