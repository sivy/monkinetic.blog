I woke this morning with [no commute ahead of me](http://redmonk.net/archives/2008/09/05/a-move-apart). What was this? Time to think?

Nope. Time to ride! I got up and went for a very short (2 mi) bike ride to get a pound of coffee from [Dunkin Donuts](https://www.dunkindonuts.com/), whose coffee I really like. Turned out the DD I was headed to doesn't open for another week. Crum. So I turned around, and rode another 2 mi to the [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com/), where I traded shiny gold rocks for a pound of rather more expensive Anniversary blend beans - although I must say this morning's coffee was not bad. I'm going to have to investigate buying [Peet's](http://www.peets.com/default.asp?rdir=1&ftv=n) over the internet, though. Finally, ride the last mile home.

*Note to self: Ride more, you're pathetic.* After riding it was a quick dip in the pool, the shower, coffee, do some dishes, another coffee, and - time for work!

Walk to the guestroom/office, put on some tunes, and log into mail, intranet, IRC. Hey, new friends! Overall my day was spent getting access to various resources, "meeting" my fellow employees in IRC/IM/Skype, getting familiar with how the team does things, and getting my first assignments.

*Yeah, this is going to be awesome.*

Highlights of the day:

* Meals with the family
* Putting Sophie on the bus and meeting her bus driver
* Taking breaks and getting to hang with the kids
