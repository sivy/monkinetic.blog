I&#39;ve been hacking on my new linklog over lunch, and finally got it fixed up enough to put up as the main home page at . There&#39;s a feed, so you can get my monkinetic posts, my google shared items, my del.icio.us links, my diggs, and my twitter updates *all in one convenient package*. Oh, the joy.

The linklog is based on Jeremy Keith&#39;s stream.php as described in [Deliciously Streaming Links](http://redmonk.net/archives/2006/11/19/deliciously-streaming-links/). Still to come - feed caching and if-modified/ETag support.

Bonus joy- the bar chart reflects post activity over the last 10 days. Hover over a bar to see how many posts for that day.
