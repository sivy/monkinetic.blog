After 7-ish years of using the vacuum we got when we got married, Jodi and I finally decided that it just wasn&#39;t cutting it anymore. We&#39;d heard the buzz about the <a href="http://dyson.com">Dyson</a> vacuums, and thought we&#39;d investigate this multi-hundred-dollar marvel.

Well, we talked ourselves into it. We came home from Lowe&#39;s (half a block from our house) with a <a href="http://www.dyson.com/range/feature_frame.asp?model=DC14-LOWREACH">Dyson DC-14 Low Reach</a>. So... was it worth it?

Heck, YES.

This vaccuum SUCKS. And I mean that in the best possible way. It&#39;s pretty quiet, the thing is engineered to the hilt (execpt for one removable peice that I&#39;m still scratching my head over - &quot;why is *that* removable?&quot;) and it handled pretty much everything I threw at it, including the two cat-hair covered <a href="http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=12&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10101&amp;productId=11055">IKEA Po&aumlaut;ng</a> armchairs that Jake and Lucy sleep on all day long.

Before I was done vacuuming the house, I had to empty the bin several times from all the dust, dirt, and cat-hair the Dyson sucked out of my recently-vacuumed carpets. It also does bare floors better than a broom, and (using the included low-reach tool) gets under furniture with a mere 2.5&quot; of clearance.

Yes, I&#39;m hyperventilating over a *vacuum cleaner*, it&#39;s that good. And heck, it&#39;s a toy that both a geek and a house-wife can love!

Update: |Seth| wondered on IM if I was now a <a href="http://www.bzzagent.com/index.jsp">BzzAgent</a>. Um, no. Not my bag. If I&#39;m shrieking about a product here it&#39;s probably that I own it and love it, or just want it really really really badly. ;-)
