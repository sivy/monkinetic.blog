Title: Photoshopping Photoshop
layout: post

According to [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html#photoshop):

&gt;The Photoshop trademark must never be used as a common verb or as a noun. The Photoshop trademark should always be capitalized and should never be used in possessive form, or as a slang term. It should be used as an adjective to describe the product, and should never be used in abbreviated form.

Oh wow, I&#39;d better make sure I&#39;m always compliant with the Permissions and Trademark Guidelines... but wait! I&#39;m looking at PS (photoshop) on my taskbar and what do I see? Photoshop&#39;s taskbar label is a Guidelines violation!

<img alt="photoshop" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36618970c" id="image2352" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36618970c-pi" />

Again, according to Adobe:

&gt;Trademarks are proper adjectives and should be followed by the generic terms they describe.
&gt;
&gt;CORRECT: The image was manipulated using Adobe Photoshop software.
&gt;
&gt;INCORRECT: The image was manipulated using Photoshop.

Hey! I could comply with the Guidelines and help Adobe do the same! So I photoshopped a quick version that Adobe is welcome to:
