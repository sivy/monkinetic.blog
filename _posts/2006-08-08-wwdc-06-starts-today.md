Title: WWDC 06 Starts Today
layout: post

So, most of us Mac users don&#39;t care about a developer conference, right?

<p style="text-align: center"><img alt="WWDC" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b3658d970c" id="image2356" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b3658d970c-pi" /></p>

*BZZT! Wrong!*

Apple&#39;s [WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/index.html?homepage) may be a techie conference which is mostly covered in a shroud of NDAs, but El Hefe&#39;s Keynote speech is always an opportunity for The Steve to show off new stuff. This year it&#39;s going to be a preview of OS X 10.5 Leopard, and who knows what else.

[The Unofficial Apple Weblog](http://www.tuaw.com) will be covering the keynote, as will [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/), [MacNN](http://live.macnn.com/), and a host of others.
