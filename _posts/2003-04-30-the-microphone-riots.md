I just finished a site for a buddy of mine, David Sleigh. His site, The Microphone Riots, is at http://www.davidsleigh.com (or <a href="http://davidsleigh.com.previewmysite.com/">here</a> until the dns propogates).

We posted up a couple full-length MP3s (160kbps) from his new album, <u>festival</u>, so check him out. If you&#39;re in the Phoenix area and like his stuff, you can see David at Stinkweeds Records, Friday May 9th at noon.

I designed the site, which is running on <a href="http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/">blosxom</a>, as well as producing the cover and CD art for the <u>festival</u> album.
