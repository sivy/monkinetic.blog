Title: Go Man, Go!
layout: post

Two Fridays ago, I was laid off from Content Connections. After touching base with a few folks I knew, and sending out a number of resumes, one in particular came together rather quickly. I got an offer early last week.

Having accepted said offer, I&#39;ll be starting a new position with [Go Daddy](http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/default.asp) on Wednesday, July 26th. I&#39;ll be working with the Creative Group, designing and building templates for several of Go Daddy&#39;s tools.

<p style="text-align: center"><a class="imagelink" href="http://redmonk.net/mt/mt-static/uploads/2006/07/gd_logo.png" title="Go Daddy!"><img alt="Go Daddy!" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b362d6970c" id="image2345" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b362d6970c-pi" /></a></p>

For me, this kind of design is going to be a challenge, and I&#39;m totally looking forward to it. The fact that the compensation is good and the benefits are fantastic is gravy. W00t!
