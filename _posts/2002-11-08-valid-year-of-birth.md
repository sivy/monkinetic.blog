Title: Valid Year Of Birth
layout: post

I was looking for Senate election results, when <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/">washingtonpost.com</a> asked me for the usual bothersome personal information. I took my usual tack of entering, shall I say, humorous, data. Looks like wp.com will have none of it. Well, darn.

Ha! Ironicly, while you&#39;re not allowed to be born in 1803, 2002 is just fine. -)
