<img alt="The Way I See It #208: I wish couple who desperately take every means to conceive a child would realize that adoptions is a wonderful alternative. A child who becomes your child through adoptions completes a family. Just as when you commit to your souse or partner there are no biological ties, yet a family is formed. This child enters a family the same way! It is not blood and flesh that form a famaily, but the heart. -- Michele Johnson" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36451970c" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36451970c-pi" title="The Way I See It #208" />
