Last year, Dan Cederholm [redesigned SimpleBits](http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2006/12/04/rebrand.html).

Now, LogoMaid has &quot;[been inspired by](http://www.flickr.com/photos/simplebitsdan/429265591/ &quot;read: appropriated&quot;)&quot; Dan&#39;s logo and is [reselling it](http://logomaid.com.nyud.net:8080/detail.php?uid=4493&amp;maincat=1).

Update: as [Dan says](http://www.flickr.com/photos/simplebitsdan/429265591/#comment72157600013428565), &quot;it gets better, folks&quot;:

&gt;The main shape according to our designer is a font symbol and you do not have the rights to claim ownership to freeware font symbols.

&gt;Other than the actual shape, I see no relevance.

&gt;Our logo was registered at c-site, the registration has been approved. According to c-site, we own the copyrights to that actual logo.

&gt;We do not need to steal anyones ideas.</a>
