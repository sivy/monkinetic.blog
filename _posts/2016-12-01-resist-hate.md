Since the election I've been trying to figure out what I can do long-term to participate in protecting the freedoms we enjoy in our society, and encourage the propagation of, rather than the inhibition of, those freedoms for those who currently lack them. One thing I can do is join and donate to organizations who are equipped to reach out to affected communities and make a difference. These include:

- The [ACLU][aclu] - They have been fighting to protect all our liberties for over 50 years.
- The [Southern Poverty Law Center][splc] - The SPLC's mission is to "monitor hate groups and other extremists throughout the United States and expose their activities to the public, the media and law enforcement."
- The [Electronic Frontier Foundation][eff] - "Founded in 1990, EFF champions user privacy, free expression, and innovation through impact litigation, policy analysis, grassroots activism, and technology development."

In addition, as a small gesture in encouraging you to get involved in helping thee and other organizations, I'm adding links to this site, right on the home page, that will let you help too.
