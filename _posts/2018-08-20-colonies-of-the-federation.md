## Silos and Colonies

Back in Dec 2017 I wrote a post called [The Revolution Will Be Federated](https://www.monkinetic.blog/the-revolution-will-be-federated.html), painting a metaphor of the major social media sites as *Distopian Underground Communities* -- the Silos -- with the haves and have-nots struggling for attention and peace.

> The Below is rife with roving gangs of trolls, descending from the Midlevels where they live in relative comfort, to harass and abuse the citizens struggling to make ends meet on the scraps of attention and spaces left to them by the Haves and those in The Above. The trolls have little to fear from The Below, save the reminder that they too are Below others. And perhaps it is *that thought* that drives them to stand on walkways and corners, hurling insults and petty self-justifications at the passing residents.

In contrast, on the surface are the federated Colonies; refugees from the Silos who have formed loosely connected communities, with activity and trade flowing freely between them.

> Each colony is self-sufficient, with resources for every inhabitant, and attention to spare. Some are small - just a few tens or hundreds of inhabitants. Others are massive, home to hundreds of thousands of residents. Here the domed and towered structures bask in the light, with a vitality and energy long since lost in the Silo.

## Progress

Over the last 8 months the number of colonies -- the network of federated platforms built on the [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) protocol -- has grown at a quick pace. There are now over 4000 instances (servers) running Twitter-like communities on the popular [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) platform.

There are also communities running a variety of other federated platforms, all connected by ActivityPub:

- [Pleroma](https://blog.soykaf.com/post/what-is-pleroma/): another microblogging platform
- [Hubzilla](https://project.hubzilla.org/page/hubzilla/hubzilla-project): a connected publishing platform with a decentralized identity model, communications, and permissions
- [Peertube](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube#--peertube) - video sharing and commenting
- [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio/): music sharing
- [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/): photo-sharing platform in active beta
- [Plume](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume): a federated blogging platform in early development

While Mastodon has had the most recent success, each of these platforms serves different communities with different needs, and fill different media and sharing niches. But they are united in building on a model of interoperability over open and standard protocols, and a culture of openness, care, and consideration.

In Phoenix a user will post to their blog on [Plume](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume), their followers on Mastodon share their thoughts and boosts that flow right back to the post's commments.

A [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/) user in Baltimore will upload their coffee poems every morning as sepia-toned photographs, using [Morii](https://mastodon.technology/@morii); later they'll watch as the humorous captions are shared from Hubzilla site to Hubzilla site.

A small production company in Los Angeles, frustrated by monetization policies on Youtube, will move their content to [Peertube](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube#--peertube), where they are followed by fans on Mastodon, [Pleroma](https://blog.soykaf.com/post/what-is-pleroma/), and other platforms.

These aren't just fantastic visions, these are going to be possible - and happening - now.

## The 99%

Lest I wax too PollyAnna-ish about the possibilities: I have the privilege of spinning fantastic metaphors around these waves of change in the social media landscape because I'm a white man in tech. I generally write about tech topics, and I don't have large numbers of Twitter users trolling my mentions just because I dared write an opinion. I don't have to depend on blocklists or spend time tending my mute filters in order to cut out the noise. Twitter was made by white men like me, *for* white men like me.

Social media technologies are *amplifiers*. These platforms provide a ramp for connecting communicators to audiences, but we have optimized for the "best-case scenarios" and stopped iterating. Twitter's popularity first began to grow [in the mid-2000s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Creation_and_initial_reaction) because it took a mostly person-to-person technology (SMS) and made it public and networked: we thought too late about what would happen when the amount of thought required to send an SMS was applied to a network-effect audience measured in the millions.

Even now - and I am absolutely embarassed to say this - Mastodon is getting attention because Twitter cut off the APIs that *let popular Twitter users see just how popular they are* (the streaming and stats tools) on third-party apps. "How dare they?" we whine. "Hey there's this other thing like Twitter, that people are using, maybe we should use that! That'll show them!" and off we stomp.

Quietly, in the meantime, Mastodon has become home to Twitter's 99%: the groups of users whose Twitter experience is a swamp of abuse, gaslighting, trolling, stalking, and culture-war baiting. A place where there simply was no way - and no tools - to escape the crowds of vicious blathering fools. Instead, they started their own spaces on Mastodon and Pleroma and other platforms, run by members of their own marginalized communities. **They started using the federated platforms because these platforms had the tools to manage and protect their communities, while maintaining connections to larger social media networks.**

It turns out that implementing federation even halfway well requires instance-management tools that also serve as community-management tools. I don't know what [Eugen Roshko](https://mastodon.social/@gargron)'s early vision for Mastodon was (other than a more open, distributed, Twitter) but I'll give him and the other Mastodon contributers credit for listening to users as the platform has developed. Mastodon allows administrators to manage what other instances their community will share activity with. It provides a variety of moderation options, from closing registrations, to blocking and muting users, to sandboxing users (only they and their current followers can see their posts). These distributed platforms put these tools *in the hands of the users who are part of the communities they serve*, not a faceless team of moderators who cannot balance the needs of users against the growth-at-all-costs culture in the company.
