## Silos and Colonies

Back in Dec 2017 I wrote a post called [The Revolution Will Be Federated](https://www.monkinetic.blog/the-revolution-will-be-federated.html), painting a metaphor of the major social media sites as *Distopian Underground Communities* -- Silos -- with the haves and have-nots struggling for attention and peace.

In contrast, on the surface are the federated Colonies; refugees from the Silos who have formed loosely connected communities, with activity and trade flowing freely between them.

## Progress

Over the last 8 months the network of federated sites -- built on the [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) protocol -- has grown. There are over 1500 instances (servers) running Twitter-like communities on the popular [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) platform.

These are connected to servers running a variety of other platforms, all connected by ActivityPub:

- [Pleroma](https://blog.soykaf.com/post/what-is-pleroma/): another microblogging platform
- [Hubzilla](https://project.hubzilla.org/page/hubzilla/hubzilla-project): a connected publishing platform with a decentralized identity model, communications, and permissions
- [Peertube](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube#--peertube) - Federated video sharing, commenting
- [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio/): federated music sharing
- [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/): federated photo-sharing platform in active beta
- [Plume](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume): a federated blog platform in development

While Mastodon has had the most recent success, each of these platforms serves different communities with different needs, and fill different media and sharing niches. But they are united in building on a model of interoperability over open and standard protocols, and a culture of openness, care, and consideration.
