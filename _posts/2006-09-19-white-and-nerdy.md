Title: White and Nerdy
layout: post

OMG, the countdown to Sept 26 continues. Witness [White and Nerdy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KyiejbQj-c) (some tidbits on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_And_Nerdy)), Weird Al&#39;s new single from [Straight Outta Lynwood](http://weirdal.com). Look for a cameo from [Seth Green](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Green) (as an action figure collector, which he really is) and an inspired appearance by [Donny Osmond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donny_Osmond) (and probably others).

_Update_: YouTube now says:

&gt;&quot;This video has been removed at the request of copyright owner RIAA because its content was used without permission&quot;.

Guess someone should have taken Weird Al&#39;s [advice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Download_This_Song):

&gt; Oh, you don&#39;t wanna mess with the R-I-double-A

&gt; They&#39;ll sue you if you burn that CD-R

&gt; It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a grandma or a seven year old girl

&gt; They&#39;ll treat you like the evil hard-bitten criminal scum you are

_Update #2_: Looks like Al [re-uploaded the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEzGIuY7kw&amp;eurl=) [himself](http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=alyankovic) to YouTube.
