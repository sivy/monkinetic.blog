The twin-towered Manchester Grand Hyatt. Jodi&#39;s company <a href="http://isecinc.com">ISEC</a> did the finishes in the lobby and  in many other parts of the hotel. Very posh!

So... Jodi and I headed out to San Diego for Memorial Day on Friday. We left Phoenix at 2:30 in the afternoon, driving west on I-10, south on 85, and then west on I-8. The weather was great, not too hot, and traffic wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as we thought it would be, given the holiday weekend. We arrived in San Diego around 9:30 pm, pretty beat from the drive. The weather in SD on Friday was evidently pretty weird- we encountered some very low, very black, very omnious clouds in the mountains on the way in, and some light fog, but no rain, so it wasn&#39;t too bad.

We got to the hotel and got checked in - the Manchester Grand Hyatt is quite impressive! Jodi&#39;s company did the lobby, which was simply huge, and amazingly decorated in various wood paneling and moldings, with several enormous chandeliers. (Pictures to come.)

We mostly crashed Friday night, after a brief &quot;thing&quot; with the front desk as we tried to get a non-smoking room (drawbacks of late check-in). The rooms were pretty nice, though not *that* much better than your standard &quot;fairly nice&quot; hotel.

Seals and beach at La Jolla!

Saturday morning we got up and decided to visit a few of the sites on our list of &quot;things to do&quot;. The first was the beach at La Jolla, a very nice area a bit north of San Diego proper. La Jolla beach is famous for the seals that generally call it home, and though there were fewer there than Jodi remembers from her last trip to La Jolla, it was cool to see them lolling around on the rocks, sunning and playing. And man, the Pacific is beautiful! Not brown like the atlantic, but ranging from deep blue to bright green. We clambered about a bit on the rocks, then walked down to the Children&#39;s Pool where the seals are usually the most plentiful, though Saturday the marine mammals seemed in short supply. Oh well.

After walking out on the beachhead and enjoying the breeze and a gawk at the few seals hanging out on the rocks on the children&#39;s pool beach, we headed back towards the car and our next destination, Torrey Pines State Reserve.
