<a href="http://www.unsanity.com">Unsanity</a> has released <a href="http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/silk/">Silk</a>, a preference pane for Mac OS X that enabled Quartz text rendering in Carbon applications. Requires Mac OS X 10.1.5, available on <a href="http://www.info.apple.com/support/downloads.html">Apple&#39;s site</a> or in SoftwareUpdate.

If you are a Mac OS X user and use Mozilla, you HAVE to get this haxie. It&#39;s... unbelievable how good it makes Mozilla look.
