[Jim Roepcke](http://jim.roepcke.com) scored a [hat trick](http://jim.roepcke.com/2007/07/08#item7730) ([what&#39;s a hat trick?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat_trick#Hockey)) in his most recent hockey game. I don&#39;t watch/play/understand hockey (seriously Jim, you need to translate &quot;a quick one-timer wrist shot in the slot that went in five-hole&quot; into something like english), but Jim&#39;s 3 goals sound just SWEET. In Jim&#39;s (hockey-lingo-peppered) words:

&gt;The second goal, I swear I have never scored a nicer goal in my life and if I ever score one nicer I will have to pinch myself. I got the puck near centre-ice, picked the right defenseman... skated around him hard on the outside, cut hard right towards the net at the goal line, on my backhand (I shoot right), faked that I was going to go around the back of the net with the puck and then as I&#39;m going behind the net I tuck the puck into the net just inside the post.

Jim&#39;s been practicing hard, skating his butt off (literally!) and his work is paying off. I sure wish I could have seen it!
