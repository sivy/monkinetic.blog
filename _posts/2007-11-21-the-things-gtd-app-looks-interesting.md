Title: The Things GTD app looks interesting

Check out [this screencast](http://tagamac.com/2007/11/things_screencast/) from [tagamac.com](http://tagamac.com) on [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/), a new <acronym title="Getting Things Done">GTD</acronym> app from [Cultured Code](http://culturedcode.com/).

I particularly like the concept of "Areas" - "an ongoing region of activity" - to group both Projects (multistep goals) and Tasks (single-step goals) together into something you can focus on. The example in the screencast is "Home Improvement", an Area that contains both a Project ("fix the storm door") and several single-step tasks.
