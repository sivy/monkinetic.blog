Title: Introducing My Power Learning
layout: post

[Content Connections](http://www.contentconnectionc.com) (the company I work for) is launching a new online learning tool called <a href="http://www.mypowerlearning.com">My Power Learning</a>. MPL is a learning style preference assessment - it helps students (especially) as well as parents, educators, or anyone - understand the modes in which they learn and communicate. The assessment is followed by a lengthy and personalized report that explains how you can study and communicate better, based on what you now know about your own learning style.

This site is the product of several years of research, and a lot of hard work by some great folks in this company. It&#39;s also the first public site I&#39;ve done all the web design on in a while, and frankly I&#39;m darn proud of it. :-)
