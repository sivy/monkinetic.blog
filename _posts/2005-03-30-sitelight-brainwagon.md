&quot;Don&#39;t try to imagine what the next big thing is: just try to figure out what the next thing you want to do is, and do it.&quot;

Mark VandeWettering is, in his words, a &quot;husband, dad, programmer, maker of telescopes, blogger, podcaster, lover of all things scientific and/or trivial, and Oakland A&#39;s fan.&quot; I&#39;m not much of a baseball fan, but Mark&#39;s weblog showcases his inner and outer geek, I love reading it, and I&#39;ve chosen it for this SiteLight.
