This sour-looking fellow is Ernst D. Bunker, a character I created for a <a href="http://www.stepwise.com/Articles/DBunker/Jan29-1998.html">short-lived series of rumor-site-parody columns</a> at StepWise. Wanted to keep him around and this is the only copy of him I have. For the curious, he was sketched and shaded on paper with pencil, then scanned and the color layed in behind in Photoshop with a semi-transparent color wash.
