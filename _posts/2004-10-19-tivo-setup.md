Title: TiVo Setup
layout: post

I&#39;m trying to get our TiVo setup so that we can successfully switch between TiVo, the VCR, the DVD player, *and* be able to watch TV on one channel while TiVo-ing another. I&#39;ve made a diagram of my proposed setup:

<div align="center"><a href="http://redmonk.net/mt/mt-static/uploads/tivo.png" title="TiVo proposed setup"><img alt="TiVo proposed setup" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b368c3970c" height="200" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b368c3970c-pi" width="177" /></a>
</div>

If anyone out there has experience with this stuff, I&#39;d love some input on whether this setup will work as hoped.

Update: based on some feedback, I&#39;ve changed my layout to send everything but the DVD through the VCR. Thoughts?
