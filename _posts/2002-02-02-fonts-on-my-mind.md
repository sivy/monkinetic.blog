While chatting with our in-house designer (and Baron Banner) we got onto the topic of our respective design backgrounds and consequently our ability to identify fonts in various ads, etc.<p>

This got me thinking about my old habit of trawling through the old type foundries looking for cool fonts. My favs have always been from <a href="http://www.emigre.com/">Emigre</a> and <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/">FontFont</a>. FontFont sells the <a href="http://www.fontfont.de/packages/meta11025/meta11025.html">font</a> that the German gov&#39;t adopted for their highway signage back in &#39;96 or so...</p>
