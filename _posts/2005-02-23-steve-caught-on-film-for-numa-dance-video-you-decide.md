layout: post

Seth <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/index/2005/02/22#TW4574">seems to think</a> that the first &quot;flash photo&quot; in this (strange, oddly compelling) <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/206373">flash movie</a> looks like me! Was I caught unawares and given interet fame? :-) You decide:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img alt="Numa snap - is it steve?" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b3614e970c" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b3614e970c-pi" />
<img alt="Will the real Steve Ivy please stand up?" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b3615c970c" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b3615c970c-pi" />
</div>

Just in case you&#39;re not sure: No, it&#39;s NOT me, dancing, or in the photo. :-P
