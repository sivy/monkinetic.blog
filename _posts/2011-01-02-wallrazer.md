For 2011, I'm going indie. I'm hanging my shingle at <http://wallrazer.com>, and I'm actually pretty excited about the prospects.

This is a big deal for me -- I haven't been outside a "regular" job for about 7 years. Mostly I'll be doing contract web development in Movable Type, python, and Django. This will be my bread and butter most of the time. I'm getting some leads from fellow [ex-Aparters](http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/21/video-egg-will-acquire-six-apart-and-rename-itself-say-media/), and I love that while the brand may be dead, the community isn't.

I also want to put more time into helping to promote Open Web technologies and the indie web. I'm hoping to make it out to [IndieWebDay](http://calagator.org/events/1250459571) and meet with other folks who care about helping site operators own their data: more homesteading, less [sharecropping](http://nomoresharecropping.org/2010/12/no-more-sharecropping/)!

Ultimately, I want to develop some ideas I've got to put these ideas into code, and release as much of that as possible as open source. As principal of my own company, **I** get to say when I can release code. *YES*.
