Title: Monsoon season hits Phoenix
layout: post

July and August are &quot;monsoon&quot; season in the desert of Arizona. I&#39;ve been here almost 3 years now and I&#39;m still not sure why it&#39;s called &quot;monsoon&quot;, but I guess theoretically we&#39;re supposed to get more rain or something. Usually we just get a lot of wind and dust, most often looking something like this.
