This past week, [Scripting News](http://scripting.com) celebrated its 11th birthday - congratulations, Dave! [Dave writes about the software](http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/04/01/11YearsOfScriptingNews.html) he used then to manage the site, [Frontier](http://frontier.userland.com/)'s [NewsPage](http://www.scripting.com/frontier/netscripting/newsPage.html) suite.

NewsPage also powered the very first version of this site, back in late 1998 ([here's a sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20000303145914/http://www.redmonk.net/) from Dec 1999, which is all archive.org had, but the look is the same).
