Title: Stonegrounds Revealed!
layout: post

This is the coffee shop where I often come to work when I&#39;m not going into the office. Free WiFi, great coffee and muffins. It&#39;s right around the corner from my house, I could walk if I weren&#39;t so lazy. ;)

Here&#39;s the inside, you can see Fezzik (my 17&quot; Powerbook) set up at one of their computer stations.
