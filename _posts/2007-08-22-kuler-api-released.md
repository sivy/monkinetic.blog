Title: Kuler API Released
layout: post

Adobe has released an [API for Kuler](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Kuler), their color-theme community that is tied into Photoshop and Illustrator.

A while back, I did some [packet-sniffing](http://redmonk.net/archives/2006/11/30/kuler-api-testing-continued/) between Adobe's Flash client (on the [kuler site](http://kuler.adobe.com)) and the servers, did some [documenting of what I found](http://deliciouslymeta.com/kuler/k_docs.php), and then developed a [quick-and-dirty app](http://deliciouslymeta.com/kuler/) that used the rough API I'd worked up. (Note: that app no longer works, though you can get the same data through the new RSS-based API).

Nice to see Adobe opening kuler up to more of this kind of thing.
