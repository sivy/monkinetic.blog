Title: Creative Commies
layout: post

It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve jumped on a bandwagon late, but I thought <a href="http://www.giantrobotprinting.com/commies/">this t-shirt</a> was really funny, so I ordered one this past week. For background, see <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/05/bill_gates_free_cult.html">this Boing Boing post</a>, and <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/06/more_gates_creative_.html">this one</a> too.

<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36877970c" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36877970c-pi" /></div>
