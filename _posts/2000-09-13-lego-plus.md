This is a Lego Mac Plus I created some months back. It&#39;s been a fixture on my NT machine ever since. I got my first Legos at age 4, and was an avid builder until my late-teens. Even now when I get a chance I pull out the small box of several hundred Legos (those that survived my childhood and that of my two brothers) and have some fun.

UPDATE 2005-03-01: New image, as the old one was lost in the site move.
