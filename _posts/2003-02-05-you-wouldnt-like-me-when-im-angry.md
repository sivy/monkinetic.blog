Mmmm, yeesss. New <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/the_hulk/superbowl/">Hulk trailer</a> online at Apple.

The Hulk has a vaguely disturbing look to him - intentionally, I&#39;m sure - he&#39;s ill proportioned in various ways that I think bring out the &quot;this poor dude is meeeeeeesssed *up*&quot; aspect of Bruce Banner. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Bana,+Eric&#39;&gt;Eric Bana&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=" http://us.imdb.com/title?0265086"="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0265086&quot;">Black Hawk Down</a>) looks great in this part - he&#39;s got that edgy-everyman thing going on.

As corny as the 1970&#39;s Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0076190">The Incredible Hulk</a> was at times, I hope this new Hulk can find some of that deep tragic feeling that you always felt as Banner (Bixby) hitchhiked away at the end of each episode.
