Title: It's in my head
layout: post

[One year ago today](http://www.monkinetic.com/2006/05/flash-header.html), some fun with a [new flash header](http://static.monkinetic.com/files/newheader/headerThingy.php) for this site. A fun experiment that managed to creep some people out and offend others. Oh well. :-)

<a href="http://redmonk.net/files/newheader/headerThingy.php"><img alt="flash_header" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36909970c" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36909970c-pi" /></a>

(Hit reload a few times to see the effect - it pulls from the same database of quotes as the &quot;R.E.M. says&quot; sidebar on this site.)
