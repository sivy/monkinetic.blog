Title: Yahoo Inline Ajax Search
layout: post

I was reading over on Yahoo and tried clicking the little purple arrow next to the world Iraq...

<a class="imagelink" href="http://redmonk.net/mt/mt-static/uploads/2006/11/yahoo_ajax_search.png" title="yahoo_ajax_search.png"><img alt="yahoo_ajax_search.png" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36436970c" id="image2396" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36436970c-pi" /></a>

...and was interested to see it loading a relatively &quot;proper&quot; Yahoo search in the popup window. Kindof cool.
