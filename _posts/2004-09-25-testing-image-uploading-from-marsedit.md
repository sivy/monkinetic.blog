This is kind of cool. [MarsEdit](http://ranchero.com/marsedit) will upload images to WordPress, if you install this [patched version](http://mycvs.org/archives/2004/08/22/combined-xml-rpc-patch-for-wordpress-12-and-ecto/) of the xmlrpc.php file.

BTW - this is Cathedral Rock, from our hike over Labor Day this year.
