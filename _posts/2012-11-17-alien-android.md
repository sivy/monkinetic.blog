After reading this article (ostensibly about the properly-impressive 440ppi screen on a new Android device) I was struck by the photos of the HTC phone, and posted this on [https://alpha.app.net/sivy/post/1587966](app.net):

>Android makers still styling devices to show off hardware features, like an Alien PC.

>iOS devices aim to make the hardware disappear, the device *is* the OS.
