REM has a photo of the artwork for the new album REVEAL on their site.<p>

<p>This is great - it&#39;s classic REM style (art directed by Micheal Stipe) - UP-ish lettering, country landscape, and shadow of Michael-with-camera. (Can any serious REM fan tell me that&#39;s NOT what we&#39;re seeing? Think &quot;Document&quot;.)</p></p>
