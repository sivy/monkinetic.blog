It doesn&#39;t do anything useful, but it looks really cool. :-) I still need a SCSI cable before it will boot (off the *10 mb* hard drive), since I don&#39;t have a System floppy.

When |Jodi| and I were first married, I found that the Mac Plus had HyperCard on it, and wrote a fun little guestbook program. The MP sat on a table by the door and we had guest sign in. Ah, the good ol&#39; days. Until this morning it sat on a ledge looking over our living room, along with the Powerbook 5400.

Also, note the <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2000/09/12/lego-plus/">LEGO Mac Plus</a> on the microshelf above the monitor.
