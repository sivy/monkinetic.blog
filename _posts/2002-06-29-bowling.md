Jodi and I went bowling last night with a bunch of friends from church.  Neither of us had been bowling since junior high, so we were  abit rusty. I think my three games were 84, 98, and 102. Ouch. But - we had a blast! Hanging out with friends, having a great time, it was all a Friday night should be. I managed a couple strikes, completely by luck I&#39;m sure! Jodi got one or two as well, and we both had (more than) our fair share of gutterballs! Thank goodness we were with friends!  -)
