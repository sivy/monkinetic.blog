Title: Rounded Menu Corners in Leopard?
layout: post

I was looking at that last post, and noticed a change in applications menus:

<img alt="leopard_menu" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36975970c" src="https://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36975970c-pi" />

Note the bottom corners of the menu, it&#39;s rounded... good or bad?
