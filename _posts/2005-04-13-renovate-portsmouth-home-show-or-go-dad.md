|Jodi| and I used to live in an <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=259+Florida+Ave,portsmouth,+va&amp;spn=0.007124,0.008315&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">old Victorian home</a> in historic Port Norfolk, Va, which we renovated to a large degree. We loved it! Soon after we moved in, my parents moved into a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=144+mount+vernon+ave,portsmouth,+va&amp;spn=0.007124,0.008315&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">house down the street</a>. (Unfortunately Google&#39;s data for each of those is a few houses off, but you get the idea.)

Well, Dad&#39;s never been able to leave well enough alone (for which I love him dearly) and -- being an architect with a penchant for history -- he went and started himself a <a href="http://home.hamptonroads.com/calendar/details.cfm?eventID=44017">home show</a> to help others learn how to restore and renovate homes in several of Portsmouth&#39;s historic neighborhoods, including Port Norfolk. There&#39;s even <a href="http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=84786&amp;ran=82410">an article</a> that appeared on the front page of the local newspaper. (<a href="http://redmonk.net/files/article.pdf">PDF version with *picture*</a>)

Go Dad!!
