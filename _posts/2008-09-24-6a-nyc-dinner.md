A bunch of us from Six Apart NYC went out to dinner tonight at [Joya](http://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/cobble-hill/4197/joya), a Thai place in Brooklyn not far from the [hotel](http://redmonk.net/archives/2008/09/23/view-from-the-nu-hotel-brooklyn) where Lisa (Six Aparter visiting from Seattle) and I are staying.

The space was pretty loud, but the music was good, the food was even better, and the company was great. :-) 8 of us went: Natalie, Angela, Matt, Lisa, Finn, Tracie, Kevin and I. I took some pics - you can find them on [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/redmonk/sets/72157607459037208/).
