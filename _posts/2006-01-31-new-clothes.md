<blockquote>Throughout this month, a <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau#Chapter_1_:_Economy">wonderful quote</a> from <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Walden">Walden</a> has been turning over in my head:</blockquote>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/merlin/93203690/" title="Thoreau"><img  align="right" alt="Henry David Thoreau" border="0" height="100" hspace="10" src="https://static.flickr.com/19/93203690_449e44bf39_t.jpg" vspace="5" width="81" /></a>I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes. If there is not a new man, how can the new clothes be made to fit? If you have any enterprise before you, try it in your old clothes. All men want, not something to do with, but something to do, or rather something to be. Perhaps we should never procure a new suit, however ragged or dirty the old, until we have so conducted, so enterprised or sailed in some way, that we feel like new men in the old, and that to retain it would be like keeping new wine in old bottles. Our moulting season, like that of the fowls, must be a crisis in our lives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>So just as, in this instance, new clothes can be seen as a fancy uniform that won't produce in its wearer the skills, mind, or experience for their intended vocation, our new year's resolutions usually leave us feeling like a chump and a failure.</blockquote>

In thinking about my own position in life and work, I actually came to a similar conclusion about myself, before reading this post. But of course, Thoreau says it much better than I could have.
